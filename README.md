# NeetCode 150 Solutions

Welcome to my personal repository dedicated to the [NeetCode 150](https://neetcode.io/practice) roadmap. 

## Overview
This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my solutions to the NeetCode 150 challenge. NeetCode 150 is a highly regarded list of 150 essential coding interview questions that cover the most critical patterns and algorithms required for technical interviews at top tech companies.

## Goal
My objective is to solve each problem systematically, focusing on:
- Understanding the underlying data structures.
- Implementing efficient algorithms (optimizing for time and space complexity).
- Documenting the logic behind each solution.

## Progress Tracking
I will be updating this repository periodically as I progress through the different categories, including:
- **Arrays & Hashing**
- **Two Pointers**
- **Sliding Window**
- **Stack**
- **Binary Search**
- **Linked List**
- **Trees**
- **Tries**
- **Backtracking**
- **Graphs**
- **Advanced Graphs**
- **1-D Dynamic Programming**
- **2-D Dynamic Programming**
- **Greedy**
- **Intervals**
- **Math & Geometry**
- **Bit Manipulation**
